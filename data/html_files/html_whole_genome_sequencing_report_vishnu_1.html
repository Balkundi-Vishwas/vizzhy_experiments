<p>Your results are also organized by disease group. SZA Longevity uses whole genome sequencing to give you insights for many health conditions. It can detect genetic variants that may predispose you to develop certain disorders in any of the disease categories listed below. It is important to understand that identifying a variant associated with one or more of these disorders does not mean that you will necessarily develop that disorder. Likewise, if we do not identify a variant, this does not eliminate the possibility that you may develop a condition included in these disease groups. We encourage you to read the short descriptions below.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular diseases cover a spectrum of conditions related to the heart and blood vessels, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and arrhythmias. Genetic factors play a significant role in the development of these diseases, with certain genes influencing cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and heart muscle function. Genetic screening can identify individuals at elevated risk, facilitating early interventions such as lifestyle changes, medication, and monitoring to prevent disease progression. Understanding one’s genetic makeup can be pivotal in customizing healthcare plans, aiming to improve quality of life and reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>Immune disorders, including autoimmune diseases and immunodeficiencies, arise from abnormal immune responses or impaired immune system functions. Genetic predispositions are key factors in the development of these disorders, influencing how the immune system distinguishes between self and non-self, potentially leading to chronic inflammation or susceptibility to infections. Genetic insights can drive personalized management strategies, incorporating immunomodulating therapies, lifestyle adjustments, and preventive care to enhance immune function and reduce disease impact.</p>
<p>Endocrine and metabolic disorders are characterized by disruptions in the body’s hormone systems and metabolic processes, leading to conditions like diabetes, thyroid disorders, and obesity. Genetics can determine one’s susceptibility to these disorders, affecting how the body produces and responds to hormones or utilizes nutrients. Comprehensive genetic assessments can guide individuals in adopting preventive measures, including dietary management, physical activity, and r egular health check-ups, to mitigate their risk and maintain metabolic balance.</p>
<p>Hematologic disorders encompass a wide range of blood-related conditions, such as anemia, hemophilia, and leukemia. These disorders can stem from genetic mutations affecting blood cell production, function, and lifespan. Early genetic testing can unveil predispositions to hematologic disorders, enabling proactive approaches to health management. This can include dietary adjustments, medication, or even gene therapy in some cases, aiming to prevent severe manifestations and improve overall well-being.</p>
<p>The miscellaneous category encapsulates a diverse array of conditions with genetic underpinnings not classified under the conventional disease categories. This includes rare genetic disorders, undiagnosed diseases, and conditions with complex genetic etiologies. Genetic testing in this area can uncover unique genetic profiles, guiding bespoke interventions, research opportunities, and support for affected individuals and their families. Tailored healthcare approaches can significantly improve outcomes for these often overlooked conditions.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial conditions involve abnormalities in mitochondrial function, crucial for energy production in cells. These disorders can be inherited through mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA mutations, affecting organs with high energy demands like the brain, heart, and muscles. Genetic testing for mitochondrial disorders can lead to early detection, allowing for interventions that may include nutritional support, exercise regimens, and in some cases, experimental treatments aimed at enhancing mitochondrial function and alleviating symptoms.</p>
<!-- image -->
<p>Neoplastic syndromes and cancers have a notable genetic component, with mutations in specific genes ncreasing the risk of developing various types of cancer. Genetic risk assessments can identify individuals with hereditary cancer syndromes, enabling preventive measures such as enhanced surveillance, prophylactic surgeries, or chemoprevention. Understanding genetic risk can empower individuals with informed choices regarding their health, potentially leading to early detection and improved prognosis.</p>
<p>Neurological disorders encompass a broad range of conditions affecting the brain, spinal cord, and nervous system. Genetic variations can influence the risk of neurological conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. Genetic testing provides valuable insights into one’s risk, acilitating early intervention strategies, such as lifestyle modifications, medications, or therapies designed to slow disease progression, improve symptoms, and enhance quality of life.</p>
<p>Genetic factors significantly influence the health of various organs, including the liver, kidneys, and lungs. Genetic predispositions can affect the risk of organ-specific diseases such as polycystic kidney disease, liver cirrhosis, and cystic fibrosis. By identifying genetic risks early, individuals can take targeted actions to preserve organ health, including lifestyle adjustments, regular screenings, and preventive treatments, aiming to prevent or delay the onset of disease and maintain organ function.</p>
<p>Syndromic diseases are characterized by a set of symptoms and features that collectively indicate a specific genetic condition. These conditions often involve multiple organ systems and can have a significant impact on health and development. Genetic analysis can identify syndromic diseases early, allowing for comprehensive management plans that address the various aspects of the condition, including medical treatment, therapeutic interventions, and support services, aimed at improving outcomes and quality of life.</p>
<p>The “Other” category includes a wide array of conditions and diseases with genetic components not covered in the above categories. This broad classification allows for the inclusion of emerging genetic findings and diseases with complex etiologies. Genetic testing in this category can provide insights into rare and less understood conditions, offering a path toward personalized care and interventions tailored to the specific needs and risks of individuals.</p>

<p>Variants listed in this section signify a certain risk but are not expected to cause disease on their own. In large population studies, these variants were present in more individuals who had disease as opposed to those who were unaffected. These variants may act in conjunction with other genetic variants and/or environmental risk factors to lead to disease. It is currently not possible to determine the likelihood of developing disease for a given individual, and many individuals will never develop symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="carrier-results">Carrier Results</h2>
<p>Being a carrier means that you have a variant in one copy of a gene associated with a recessive disease. This means that you have one ‘non-working’ copy of the gene, along with one ‘working’ copy. Recessive disorders require an individual to have two variants in order to develop the disease, therefore you ‘carry’ a variant but you are not at risk to have this disease yourself. However, you may be at risk to have children affected with this disease, if your reproductive partner is also a carrier for the same condition. It is important to discuss these results with a genetic counselor or other qualified healthcare professional for family planning purposes. In some recessive conditions, carriers may express mild symptoms. Please see the detailed report for specific information about your findings. The conditions and genes included in our carrier screening section of myGenome were selected based on recommendations from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)</p>

<p>Each of our bodies is unique, including our responses to drugs and medications. Certain genetic variations (or changes) may influence how we metabolize or react to certain drugs. In some cases, these genetic variations could amplify the beneficial effect of a drug or on the other hand, decrease its effectiveness. In extreme situations, individuals who carry certain genetic variations may experience adverse drug reactions. This knowledge may help your physician to tailor medication to your personal genetic map, by minimizing adverse reactions and maximizing the positive outcome.NOTE: Never change your drug regimen except under the guidance of a clinical pharmacologist or other authorized healthcare provider. See technical note for important limitations of the test.</p>

<p>Some genes in your genome are associated with disorders that are severe but may not manifest until long after birth, sometimes not until later in adulthood. When variants are detected in such genes, it is important to discuss this result with a healthcare provider to determine next steps. These can include additional clinical exams to be able to catch early signs of a disease that may otherwise be overlooked. Sometimes, action can be taken to prevent the disorder from occurring, or to alter in some way its natural progression. We looked at genes associated with the most common genetic disorders. We also examined a number of position in other genes where well-known variants that occasionally result in disease can occur. In addition, we looked at genes that are associated with ‘recessive’ diseases, which usually only develop if an individual has two variants in a gene (one on each copy). If you have only one variant you are a ‘carrier’, which means that you may be at risk to have children affected with this disease, if your reproductive partner is also a carrier for the same condition.</p>

<h2 id="disease-description">Disease Description:</h2>
<p>Southeast Asian ovalocytosis is a hereditary red blood cell disorder that is widespread in certain ethnic groups of Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Ovalocytic erythrocytes are rigid and exhibit reduced expression of many erythrocyte antigens. The ovalocytes are resistant to invasion in vitro by several strains of malaria, including Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium knowlesi (summary by Jarolim et al., 1991). The disorder is most often asymptomatic but has been reported to be associated with signs of mild hemolysis such as intermittent jaundice and gallstones (summary by Reardon et al., 1993).|Reference:DiseaseName:Southeast Asian ovalocytosis| DiseaseSource:MONDO|Orphanet|Disease SourceID:MONDO:0008165|ORPHA98868|OMIM number:166900</p>

<h2 id="epidemiology">Epidemiology:</h2>
<p>Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) is a genetic red cell disorder, particularly prevalent in certain populations of Southeast Asia, including Malaysians, Indonesians, and Papua New Guineans, although cases have been reported worldwide. SAO is characterized by the presence of elliptical or oval-shaped red blood cells, which can provide some protection against malaria. The disorder’s prevalence is estimated to be around 25-30% in certain Southeast Asian populations, but it is rare in other ethnic groups. SAO exhibits an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to have the disorder. Carriers of a single copy of the mutated gene (heterozygotes) do not typically show symptoms of the disorder. However, homozygotes (individuals who inherit two copies of the mutated gene) may experience mild hemolytic anemia and may be more susceptible to complications such as acute splenic sequestration and aplastic crisis. Despite these potential complications, many individuals with SAO remain asymptomatic throughout their lives.</p>
<h2 id="lifestyle-actions">Lifestyle Actions:</h2>
<p>Effective management of Southeast Asian ovalocytosis involves a proactive lifestyle approach for optimal prevention. Regular blood tests, hemoglobin analysis, and comprehensive healthcare assessments are crucial in monitoring the condition. Adopting a balanced diet, rich in essential nutrients, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are key to long-term well-being. Regular exercise, tailored to individual fitness levels, can help enhance overall health. Genetic counseling is also beneficial in developing personalized prevention strategies for individuals and their families, providing valuable insights into the genetic aspects of the condition. By staying informed and committed to these lifestyle actions and prevention measures, individuals with Southeast Asian ovalocytosis can effectively manage their condition and maintain a high quality of life.</p>
<h2 id="risk-factors">Risk Factors:</h2>
<p>Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) is a genetic condition primarily affecting individuals from Southeast Asian descent, characterized by the presence of unique elliptical-shaped red blood cells. Although SAO is often asymptomatic, it has been associated with an increased risk of certain health complications, particularly in relation to blood flow and oxygenation. One such complication is cerebral malaria, where SAO’s impact on red blood cell rigidity may exacerbate the adhesion of infected red blood cells to blood vessel walls, leading to impaired blood flow and potential brain damage. Additionally, SAO has been linked to increased susceptibility to severe respiratory infections, as the altered red blood cells may struggle to deliver adequate oxygen to lung tissues. Furthermore, individuals with SAO might experience heightened complications during surgery due to the abnormal red blood cell shape and function. While research continues to explore the relationship between SAO and these health issues, maintaining overall well-being through regular medical check-ups, early detection, and appropriate management of potential complications remains crucial for individuals with SAO.</p>

<h2 id="risk-factors-1">Risk Factors:</h2>
<p>Cryohydrocytosis, a rare genetic condition, is characterized by the presence of spiculated or spherical ice crystals in red blood cells and an increased susceptibility to cold-induced hemolysis. While the relationship between cryohydrocytosis and the development of specific health complications is not well-understood, several risk factors may contribute to its progression. Inherited genetic mutations, particularly those affecting the RHAG protein, have been linked to cryohydrocytosis. Exposure to extreme cold temperatures can exacerbate symptoms, as the decreased environmental temperature may trigger the formation of ice crystals within red blood cells, leading to hemolysis and potential anemia. Certain medications, such as vasodilators or antimalarial drugs, may interact with the condition, increasing the risk of complications. Individuals with cryohydrocytosis may also be at an increased risk of developing hemolytic anemia, particularly in response to infection or other stressors. Additionally, a family history of cryohydrocytosis or related hemolytic disorders may further heighten the risk of symptom onset. Further research is needed to better understand the complex interplay of risk factors contributing to the development and progression of cryohydrocytosis.</p>

<h2 id="epidemiology-2">Epidemiology:</h2>
<p>Thyroid hormone metabolism disorders are a group of uncommon conditions that affect the body’s ability to produce, transport, or metabolize thyroid hormones. Among these, Thyroid Hormone Metabolism, Abnormal, Type 2 (THMA2) is a rare inherited disorder with a prevalence estimated to be around 1 in 100,000 individuals worldwide. This condition is characterized by an impairment in the deiodination of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3), leading to reduced levels of active T3 and increased levels of inactive reverse T3 (rT3). THMA2 exhibits autosomal recessive inheritance and is caused by mutations in the type 2 deiodinase (DIO2) gene. The disorder can manifest at any age, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe, including fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, and depression. Both genders are susceptible, and its prevalence spans across diverse ethnic backgrounds. Early diagnosis and treatment of THMA2 are crucial to prevent long-term complications and improve quality of life.</p>
<h2 id="lifestyle-actions-2">Lifestyle Actions:</h2>

Implementing lifestyle modifications can significantly contribute to improved thyroid health and overall well-being. These adjustments may include maintaining a balanced diet, rich in essential nutrients that support thyroid function, and avoiding foods that hinder hormone metabolism. Regular physical activity, tailored to individual needs and capabilities, can help regulate thyroid hormone levels. Stress management techniques, such as mindfulness, meditation, and yoga, have been shown to positively influence thyroid hormone metabolism. Furthermore, seeking genetic counseling can provide valuable insights into personalized prevention strategies, particularly for those with a family history of thyroid disorders.</p>
<h2 id="risk-factors-2">Risk Factors:</h2>
<p>Disruptions in thyroid hormone metabolism have been identified as a significant risk factor for the development of various endocrine and cardiovascular disorders. Dysregulation of thyroid hormone levels, either through hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, can lead to a wide range of complications, including impaired cardiac function, altered metabolism, and development of goiters. Genetic predisposition, autoimmune diseases, and iodine deficiency are among the primary contributors to abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism. Autoimmune disorders such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and Graves’ disease can lead to autoantibody production, causing thyroid gland dysfunction and subsequent hormonal imbalances. Iodine deficiency, a global health concern, can result in goiter development and hypothyroidism. Furthermore, certain medications, radiation exposure, and environmental toxins have been linked to thyroid hormone metabolism disruptions. Identifying and managing abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism is crucial for preventing potential long-term health complications and ensuring appropriate hormonal balance.</p>

<p>Being a carrier means that you have a variant in one copy of a gene associated with a recessive disease. This means that you have one ‘non-working’ copy of the gene, along with one ‘working’ copy. Recessive disorders require an individual to have two variants in order to develop the disease, therefore you ‘carry’ a variant but you are not at risk to have this disease yourself. However, you may be at risk to have children affected with this disease, if your reproductive partner is also a carrier for the same condition. It is important to discuss these results with a genetic counselor or other qualified healthcare professional for family planning purposes. In some recessive conditions, carriers may express mild symptoms. Please see the detailed report for specific information about your findings.

<h2 id="traits">Traits</h2>

<p>Traits pertain to characteristics that are heavily influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Some of these characteristics are modifiable with lifestyle changes, such as exercise, diet, and nutrition - while some are quirky predispositions. Because of the complexity of these traits, you may find that some interpretations ring true, whereas others may not. You may carry variants with additive effects, or even opposing effects. An example of the latter is one variant that predisposes you to straight hair and one that predisposes you to curly hair. Information published on individual variants often do not take into account the effects of variants in various combinations, but only their independent effects. myGenome includes the following lifestyle trait categories.</p>
<p>We all know that we experience the world around us using our five senses (taste, touch, sight, hearing, smell). What isn’t always as obvious is that there are clear and sometimes large sensory differences between individuals. Environmental and social factors influence our reactions to these sensations, and our individual genetic differences can also profoundly influence our perceptions.</p>
<p>When you look in the mirror, what you see-from height, hair, and skin tones to eye color-is greatly determined by your genes. Think of identical twins and their amazing similarities. Identical genomes make twins as incredibly identical as they are. Therefore, your genetic makeup greatly influences the physical attributes you are born with, but doesn’t restrict you from deciding the appearance that best fits your personality.</p>
<p>Low fat, low carb, low iron, dairy-free … are all food trends fads or do your genes play a role? Nutrient absorption could be based on your genetic makeup. This report examines genes and variants associated with nutritional needs and biological responses to diet, which could help you identify discrepancies between your current diet and your daily nutritional needs.</p>
<p>Is losing or gaining weight easy for you? Has this changed as you’ve grown older? Your current metabolism and your genes both play large roles in weight maintenance and changes you’ll experience over time. Some people convert their meals into energy more efficiently or faster than others. How you eat and exercise can affect your metabolism, and your genetic makeup makes important contributions to how responsive you are to exercise. These results will give you insight into your metabolic predispositions and may help you adjust certain aspects of your lifestyle.</p>
<p>Ever wonder if you have a genetic predisposition for extreme longevity? Longevity record holders are renowned for their amazing youthfulness-dancing, playing golf, riding bicycles, and going out for nights on the town-even beyond age 100! Scientific studies of these people suggest that both genetic and environmental factors (like diet) are critical for slow and healthy aging. Matching the right environmental factors to genetic factors is probably key, and in just the past few years science has discovered some of the most critical factors for promoting longevity.</p>
<p>Think about puberty, PMS, or pregnancy-hormones have a way of wreaking havoc. But these distressing roller coaster experiences underscore the critical importance of normal hormonal functions in regulating both body and mind. Our bodies use hormones to send signals or messages to distant cells and organs, to regulate many important biological processes. Hormones influence physical processes such as metabolism, development, and reproduction, and they can also profoundly influence our moods, feelings, and thoughts. The genetic variations governing some of our hormonal systems should provide insight into certain predispositions in these traits.</p>

<p>Is your family history largely free of heart disease? This might be partly due to genetic variants you carry. The cardiovascular (circulatory) system includes your heart and blood vessels. The heart pumps blood through the blood vessels (arteries, veins, capillaries) to deliver oxygen throughout the body, as well as to remove wastes from tissues. Cardiovascular health depends to a great degree on many factors aside from the heart and blood vessels, including blood composition.</p>
<p>Studies of twins-especially twins separated at birth-tell us that many behavioral traits are greatly influenced by our genes. Some of our personality and mental traits are shaped by environmental and cultural influences. Do you have trouble staying away from sugary snacks? Do you prefer sweet over savory treats? Variants in this section may give some genetic clues.</p>
<p>Were you born a sprinter or is endurance your thing? Genetic tests can’t tell you whether you have what it takes to become an Olympic champion, but information about your specific genetic variants will help you to know if you are more likely to be a sprinter or marathoner, and to customize training strategies, maximize training efficiency, and potentially improve your athletic performance.</p>
<p>Are you the one in your family who always catches that bug? The immune system is vastly complex and actually consists of two functionally different but critically important systems: the innate immune system and the acquired immune system. Our innate immune system provides genetic defenses against all pathogenic invaders, while the acquired immune system relies on previous exposures and cellular ‘memories’ of those exposures. Genetic variants determine many important differences between individual’s immune systems.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why you react differently from other people to certain substances? Certain genetic variants can influence sensitivity to certain key compounds like caffeine and alcohol, affecting whether you flush after having a few drinks, or need more coffee than others to give you that early morning kick.</p>

<h2 id="description-1">Description</h2>
<p>Vitamin B6 is composed of six compounds that play crucial roles in various metabolic processes in the body, including the production of neurotransmitters used for nerve communication and other vital biological functions. It is naturally present in meats, animal organs (such as beef liver), starchy vegetables, and non-citrus fruits. Additionally, vitamin B6 can be found in lower amounts in fortified plantbased foods, grains, and vitamin supplements. Inadequate levels of vitamin B6 may lead to anemia, skin issues, and a weakened immune system. Specific gene variants have been identified as influencers of the circulating levels of vitamin B6 in the bloodstream.</p>

Foods like butter, palm and coconut oils, cheese, and red meat have high amounts of saturated fat.Weight gain. Many high-fat foods such as pizza, baked goods, and fried foods have a lot of saturated fat. Eating too much fat can add extra calories to your diet and cause you to gain weight. All fats contain 9 calories per gram of fat. This is more than twice the amount found in carbohydrates and protein.</p>

<h2 id="lactose-intolerance">Lactose Intolerance</h2>
<h2 id="description-8">Description</h2>
<p>Lactose intolerance refers to an impaired ability to digest lactose, a sugar present in milk and other dairy products. In infancy, lactose is typically broken down by an enzyme called lactase, produced by cells in the lining of the small intestine. However, the production of this enzyme ceases during or after weaning, and most adult mammals, including humans, become unable to efficiently digest lactose. Primary lactase deficiency, also known as lactase nonpersistence, is the most prevalent type of lactase deficiency.</p>

This intolerance manifests as gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain following the consumption of dairy products due to the undigested lactose fermenting in the gut.On the other hand, individuals with the CT or TT genotypes are more likely to continue producing lactase throughout their lives, allowing them to digest milk and other dairy products without adverse effects. The TT genotype is associated with a higher likelihood of being able to digest milk in adulthood compared to the CT genotype.</td>

<p>Overweight and obesity have become prevalent conditions in the United States, characterized by an increase in the size and number of fat cells in the body. Medical professionals utilize measurements such as body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference to screen and diagnose these conditions. Obesity, a serious medical issue, can lead to complications like metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, heart disease, diabetes, high blood cholesterol, cancers, and sleep disorders. Treatment approaches vary based on the cause, severity, and presence of complications, including lifestyle changes such as heart-healthy eating and increased physical activity, FDA-approved weight-loss medicines, and, in some cases, surgical interventions.

The augmentation of muscle volume is typically attributed to the enlargement of muscle cell size rather than an increase in the number of cells. Environmental factors, such as exercise, can impact muscle volume, and genetic factors play a role in determining both one’s inherent muscle volume and how effectively muscles respond to training.</p>

<h2 id="description-24">Description</h2>
<p>This type of fat, known as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), remains in a liquid state at room temperature. Two main categories of PUFAs are omega-6 and omega-3. Omega-6 fatty acids are present in liquid vegetable oils like corn oil, safflower oil, and soybean oil. On the other hand, omega-3 fatty acids are derived from plant sources such as canola oil, flaxseed, soybean oil, and walnuts, as well as from seafood, including fatty fish (e.g., salmon, tuna, trout) and shellfish (e.g., crab, mussels, oysters). Specific omega-3 fatty acids like EPA and DHA are abundant in seafood, while another type, ALA (alphalinolenic acid), is found in various foods, including some vegetable oils like canola and soy. Omega-3s are also available in dietary supplements, with fish oil supplements containing EPA and DHA, and flaxseed oil supplements containing ALA. While there is moderate evidence supporting the health benefits of consuming seafood, the health advantages of omega-3 dietary supplements remain unclear (Source: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health; National Institutes of Health; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services).

People with this genotype tend to excel in sports that require a burst of speed and strength, like sprinting or weightlifting.CT Genotype (Also known as RX): This genotype results in a mix of muscle types, giving a balance between power and endurance. Athletes with CT may be good at sports that require both speed and stamina, but they might not be the fastest sprinters or the most enduring long- distance runners.TT Genotype (Also known as XX): This genotype leads to a lack of the protein mentioned earlier, which can make it harder for muscles to contract quickly and powerfully. While some research suggests that individuals with TT might not be as successful in power sports, there’s also evidence that they could have an advantage in endurance sports, where sustained effort is more important than quick bursts of power.</td>

<h2 id="description-27">Description</h2>
<p>Metabolic syndrome is a term used to describe a cluster of risk factors that elevate the likelihood of developing heart disease and other health issues, including diabetes and stroke. The term "“metabolic”" refers to the biochemical processes integral to the body’s normal functioning. Risk factors encompass traits, conditions, or habits that increase the probability of disease development. In this context, "“heart disease”" primarily refers to coronary heart disease (CHD), wherein plaque, a waxy substance, accumulates inside the coronary arteries, leading to their hardening and narrowing. This process reduces blood flow to the heart muscle, potentially causing chest pain, heart attacks, cardiac damage, or even death.

This receptor is involved in the sense of smell and can influence an individual’s sensitivity to specific odors. Specifically, the rs1953558 SNP has been associated with the perception of isovaleric acid, a chemical compound commonly associated with the smell of sweat, particularly the odor of feet.According to the search results provided, individuals with the TT genotype at the rs1953558 locus exhibit a slightly reduced sensitivity to the smell of isovaleric acid. This means that these individuals may require a higher concentration of isovaleric acid to detect the odor compared to those with other genotypes. In contrast, individuals with the TC or CC genotypes may have a heightened sensitivity to this odorant.The variation in olfactory sensitivity linked to the rs1953558 SNP is part of a broader pattern of genetic diversity in human olfaction. It is estimated that there is about a 30% difference in olfactory receptors among individuals, which can explain why some people can detect certain smells while others cannot. (PMID: 17973576)*.</td>

<h2 id="description-31">Description</h2>
<p>Finger length is commonly measured from the point where the finger joins the hand to the tip of the finger. The finger length ratio, often denoted as 2D:4D, represents the ratio of the lengths of the index and ring fingers. This ratio is calculated by dividing the length of the index finger on one hand by the length of the ring finger on the same hand. Evidence suggests that the 2D:4D ratio may correlate with certain human characteristics, such as increased reproductive success or a reduced risk of video game addiction. These correlations vary between males and females, with the differences thought to result from in utero exposure to hormones.In general, 2D:4D is higher in females (M = 0.979 SD = 0.030) than in males (M = 0.964, SD = 0.031); this difference was highly significant [t(977) = _7.3, P = 6.48 _ 10_13].More men than women have shorter index fingers than ring fingers, resulting in a lower 2D:4D ratio. Therefore, a lower 2D:4D ratio is indicative of a more masculine hormonal profile or environment during fetal development. These differences are influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.</p>

<td>In summary, the rs2073711 CC genotype has been associated with a typical risk of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVD), while CT and TT are representing lower risk of Lumbar Disk Disease.The rs2073711 SNP (1184T_C ) is located in exon 8 of the cartilage intermediate layer protein gene (CILP). However, CILP gene is primarily known to be expressed abundantly in intervertebral discs, and was reported to have increased expression when degeneration occurs [PMID 15864306]. For the rs2073711 SNP, the ancestral allele is T and the disease associated risk allele is C. A study of Asian patients with lumbar disc disease (LDD) implicates each copy of a (C) allele of SNP rs2073711 (as oriented with respect to dbSNP) as increasing risk about 1.6 fold.

<h2 id="description-40">Description</h2>
<p>A ligament is a band of tissue that connects bone to bone. Ligament injuries, often involving the knee, are common. The knee has several ligaments, each serving a specific function. The Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) runs along the inside of the knee, preventing it from bending inward, while the Lateral Collateral Ligament (LCL) runs along the outside, preventing excessive outward bending. The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL), located in the middle, helps prevent the shin bone from sliding forward. The Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) complements the ACL by preventing the shin bone from sliding backward under the thigh bone. Injuries to these ligaments can range from stretching to partial or complete tears, leading to symptoms such as pain, swelling, and a sensation of the knee "“giving out”" when pressure is applied.</p>

<p>Menopause refers to the cessation of a woman’s menstrual cycle, indicating the end of her reproductive capability. This natural biological process also signifies the conclusion of her ability to conceive children. Menopause involves significant hormonal changes, leading to symptoms like hot flashes and mood alterations. The onset of menopause is typically recognized when there has been a 12-month span without menstruation. In the United States, the average age of menopause is around 51 years, though individual variations exist. Factors influencing the timing of menopause include natural hormonal variations, medical conditions or treatments affecting hormone production, and surgical interventions like the removal of the ovaries, a key source of female sex hormones. Additionally, genetic variations play a role in determining the age at which menopause occurs.</p>

<h2 id="description-49">Description</h2>
<p>Earwax, scientifically termed cerumen, is a universal waxy substance produced by glands in the ear canals, serving as a protective barrier for the ear’s sensitive skin and defense against germs. Determined by the ABCC11 gene variant, individuals of European and African descent typically have wet earwax, while those of East Asian descent often exhibit dry, crumbly earwax. This genetic diversity highlights the subtle yet fascinating ways in which our genes shape seemingly ordinary aspects of our physiology, emphasizing the essential role earwax plays in maintaining ear health across different populations.</p>

<h2 id="description-51">Description</h2>
<p>Freckles are clusters of concentrated melaninized cells that are particularly noticeable on fair skin. The primary environmental trigger for the formation of freckles is exposure to sunlight. When exposed to UVB radiation, melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin, increase their melanin production. This heightened melanin production causes freckles to darken, making them more visible. In cases where there are densely distributed concentrations of melanin, freckles may multiply and extend over a broader area of the skin.</p>

<h2 id="description-61">Description</h2>
<p>Caffeine, a bitter substance, naturally occurs in over 60 plants, including coffee beans, tea leaves, kola nuts (used to flavor colas), and cacao pods (utilized in chocolate production). Synthetic caffeine is also artificially created and added to certain medicines, foods, and beverages. Examples include pain relievers, cold medicines, over-the-counter alertness medications, energy drinks, as well as energyboosting gums and snacks.The primary sources of caffeine consumption are beverages, with varying caffeine content in different drinks. Generally, the caffeine amounts are as follows: 8-ounce cup of coffee = 95-200 mg, 12-ounce can of cola = 35-45 mg, 8-ounce energy drink = 70-100 mg, 8-ounce cup of tea = 14-60 mg. Caffeine affects the body’s metabolism in various ways; it stimulates the central nervous system, providing a feeling of wakefulness and energy boost. Caffeine acts as a diuretic, promoting the elimination of excess salt and water through increased urination. It also enhances stomach acid release, potentially causing upset stomach or heartburn. Moreover, caffeine may impact calcium absorption and elevate blood pressure.Upon consumption, caffeine reaches its peak level in the bloodstream within one hour, with effects lasting for four to six hours.

During deep sleep, electrical activity in the brain appears in long, slow waves called delta waves. These waves have a frequency of 0.5 to 2 Hertz.Research studies have identified a variation in the ADA gene, revealing its influence on deep sleep. The ADA gene, responsible for producing the adenosine deaminase enzyme, plays a crucial role in breaking down adenosine? molecule central to the regulation of various physiological processes. Alterations in the ADA gene correlate with a diminished conversion of adenosine, potentially resulting in an accumulation of adenosine and heightened fatigue. This insight underscores the significance of genetic factors in shaping the intricacies of deep sleep and its impact on overall physiological well-being.</p>

A study (PMID: 21734253) highlights that this functional ADA polymorphism, particularly the T allele (TT genotype) of rs73598374, results in reduced ADA activity due to an amino acid substitution, and is associated with deeper sleep and decreased vigilant attention. Consequently, individuals carrying the T allele may experience more profound sleep phases and might find it challenging to sustain alertness during specific tasks.</td>

<h2 id="description-63">Description</h2>
<p>In most cases, Alzheimer? does not have a single genetic cause. Instead, it can be influenced by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. Consequently, a person may carry more than one genetic variant or group of variants that can either increase or reduce the risk of Alzheimer?.The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene makes a protein which, when combined with fat, becomes a lipoprotein. The lipoprotein ApoE is a very low-density lipoprotein, responsible in part for removing cholesterol from the bloodstream. Variations in ApoE affect cholesterol metabolism, which in turn alter your chances of having heart disease and in particular a heart attack or a stroke. Variations in ApoE are also associated with altered odds of having Alzheimer’s disease and other diseases.There are three relatively common allelic variants of ApoE, as defined by two SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412 known as ApoE-_2, ApoE-_3, and ApoE-_4. The proteins produced by these genes are called ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4. When rs429358 has the allele C and rs7412 has the allele T, the resulting isoform is _1.When rs429358 has the allele T and rs7412 has the allele T, the resulting isoform is _2.When rs429358 has the allele T and rs7412 has the allele C, the resulting isoform is _3.When rs429358 has the allele C and rs7412 has the allele C, the resulting isoform is _4.The most common variant overall is the “standard” ApoE-_3, and therefore more people inherited one ApoE-_3 from each parent than any other of the possible pairs of variants. Note that each of these types can actually have additional changes too, so there are different subtypes as well.APOE _2 may provide some protection against the disease. If Alzheimer? occurs in a person with this allele, it usually develops later in life than it would in someone with the APOE _4 gene. Roughly 5% to 10% of people have this allele.APOE _3, the most common allele, is believed to have a neutral effect on the disease ?neither decreasing nor increasing risk of Alzheimer?.APOE _4 increases risk for Alzheimer? and is associated with an earlier age of disease onset in certain populations. About 15% to 25% of people have this allele, and 2% to 5% carry two copies.</p>

<p>This SNP , located in the fourth exon of the ApoE gene, affects the amino acid at position 130 of the resulting protein. The more common rs429358 allele is (T). If the allele is (C) and the same chromosome also harbors the rs7412(C) allele, the combination is known as an APOE-_4 allele. The APOE-_4 allele has a strong influence on the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.CC genotype represents one of 2 snps relevant to classifying APOE genotype;CT genotype represents &gt;3x increased risk for Alzheimer’s; 1.4x increased risk for heart disease while TT represents common risk.</p>
<p>The rs7412(T) allele, also known as Arg176Cys, generally indicates the presence of an Apo_2 allele.APOE _2 may provide some protection against the disease.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and can lead to tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination. While the exact cause of Parkinson’s is not fully understood, research has identified several genetic variants that can increase the risk of developing the disease.</p>

<td>First discovered in 2004, rs34637584 is a SNP indicating a position within the LRRK2 that encodes a variant protein. This SNP is commonly referred to as the G2019S variant (or, mutation) based on the potential change from glycine (encoded by rs34637584(G) allele) to serine (encoded by the rs34637584(A) allele) at position 2019 of the LRRK2 protein.[PMID 15680456][PMID 15680455]One copy of a rs34637584(A) allele is sufficient to greatly increase one’s risk for Parkinson’s disease(refer to GA and AA genotype). It is considered a disease causing mutation because it is rarely found in healthy, elderly people without Parkinson’s disease, and it has been found in both familial and sporadic types of the disease. While there are many different SNPs that can influence one’s risk for Parkinson’s disease, rs34637584 is an especially common cause of the disease in Berber Arabs and Ashkenazi Jews. Overall, the risk of Parkinson’s disease for a person who inherits a rs34637584(A) allele is 28% at age 59, 51% at 69, and 74% at 79, according to the International LRRK2 Consortium. [PMID 18539534]The GG genotype represents a normal risk of developing Parkinson’s diseases.</td>

<p>The N370S mutation in the GBA gene is linked to Gaucher disease Type 1, but it also increases the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. This connection highlights the broader impact of GBA gene mutations beyond Gaucher disease, particularly in relation to neurodegenerative diseases. The relationship is believed to be due to the role of glucocerebrosidase in cellular pathways that, when disrupted, contribute to the development of Parkinson’s disease.C;C): High risk (6) for Gaucher’s disease, type 1.(C;T): Carrier (3) of Gaucher disease allele; potential increased risk for Parkinson’s.For the N370S variant (rs76763715) in the GBA gene: (C;C) High risk (6) for Gaucher’s disease type 1;(C;T) Carrier (3) of Gaucher disease allele potential increased risk for Parkinson’s (T;T) Common (0) variant with no associated risk.</p>
